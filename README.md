This is my portfolio ecommerce project inpired by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6). My solution is built by React JS using Styled Components. Other than than, it doesn't use any framework or library. All the components and fuctionality were coded from scrach by me.

## Responsive Design

This e-commerce page is implemented in both mobile version and desktop version. Desktop version shows some cool hovering effects, besides mobile version contains modal side bar menu and carousel for displaying product images.
